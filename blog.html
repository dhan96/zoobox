<p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 200px;">Recipe a Lion Burger Meal: This requires a piece of lion meat, pretzel bread buns, unions, lettuce, tomatoes, and other toppings. First, cut your meat using a knife into a circle or square shape as big as you want your burger to be. Next, Put your cut steack on the grill and cook until only a little pink shows in the middle. You can also fry your steak to create a fired lion burger. Finally, put your cooked meat on your buns and add all the condiments and toppings you would like. Stay tuned for more new recipes. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 200px;"><b>Cooking with Kangaroo:</b>
Firstly the meat should be soaked in oil for at least 15 min prior to cooking.  It should then be placed in a very hot pan and quickly turned over to ensure all sides are 'seared', that is browned.  This will seal the meat up to prevent moisture loss. 

If pan frying the temperature can then be turned down a little and the cut cooked to medium rare.  If roasting it can be transferred to the oven, but once again not cooked further than medium rare.
Guide to cooking times:

Stir Fry: (5mm thick) 1 minute maximum
Kebabs: (1.5cm cubes) 2 minute per side (leave space between cubes)
Medallions: Steaks (2.5cm thick) 2-3 minutes per side.
Roasts: Brown in pan then cook in pre-heated oven for 8-12 minutes per 500gms at 220 degrees Celsius or 15-20 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius (thick roasts may take longer than thin regardless of weight).
Provided these simple steps are followed cuts of kangaroo can be prepared in the same way as for any other meat. Kangaroo mince is even easier to use and can be cooked exactly as other minces. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 200px;"><b>Ostrich Steak/Fillet:</b>
Ostrich Meat has a very low fat content and for this reason, it is best to cook over a high heat to seal the meat, then reduce heat and cook as a Beef Steak according to the cut. 

The fillet is wonderful just cooked on its own to appreciate the full natural flavour.  The great thing about fillet is that it can be cooked to your taste, and can even be eaten raw (as Carpaccio) so a little pink in the middle is ideal and will maximise your enjoyment of this product.  Over cooking to very well done will ruin the steak. 

Ostrich Steaks are excellent with your favourite marinade, with cranberry jelly or redcurrant sauce being particularly good. 

Cooking times: Fry for approx. 3 to 4 minutes per side - check during cooking with a knife by cutting open slightly.  If grilling under a gentle heat, cook for approx. 6 minutes each side and check with a knife as per above.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 200px;"><b>Buffalo Rib Roast:</b> 
This is a favorite recipe.  The orange-molasses glaze is flecked with mustard seeds to give it texture and flavor. The resulting spicy, sweet crust that it imparts to the roast is quite captivating.  This approach works equally well with other domestic cuts of meat such as a beef standing rib roast or a pork loin.  This is a great dish for a holiday dinner especially when coupled with the carrot-sweet potato puree. 

a)	1 buffalo rib or top sirloin roast (7 to 9 pounds)
b)	1 tablespoon olive oil 
c)	1 and quarter cups (1 medium) finely minced red onions 
d)	3 tablespoons finely minced garlic 
e)	1 tablespoon cracked black pepper 
f)	half cup balsamic vinegar 
g)	1 & a quarter cups fresh orange juice 
h)	1 tablespoon grated orange zest 
i)	1/3 cup molasses 
j)	1 Tablespoon coriander seeds, toasted and crushed 
k)	Quarter cup yellow mustard seeds 
l)	1 cup dry red wine 
m)	2 cups beef, veal or basic Game Meat Stock 
n)	Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 
o)	Carrot--Sweet Potato Puree (recipe follows) 

Carefully trim roast to remove all but a thin layer of fat.  Tie securely if desired and set aside in a roasting pan or a rack.
Heat oil in a separate saucepan and saute onions and garlic until just beginning to color.  Add pepper, vinegar, orange juice, zest, molasses, coriander and mustard seeds and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes or until glaze is lightly thickened.   Cool. 

Generously paint roast with glaze and allow to sit at least 2 hours at room temperature, or overnight refrigerated, before roasting (bring back to room temperature before roasting).  Reserve any remaining glaze to baste roast during cooking. 
Preheat oven to 450F and roast for 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to 325 and continue to cook until a meat thermometer registers 130F.  Be careful not to overcook or meat will be dry and chewy.  Baste roast occasionally with any remaining glaze. 

Remove roast from pan and keep warm.  Add wine and stock to roasting pan and bring to a boil, scraping up any brown bits.  Reduce slightly and then strain juices. Correct seasoning with salt and pepper.  Slice roast and serve with warm pan juices and a dollop of carrot-sweet potato purse.  Leftover roast can be used to make Buffalo Chili. </p>
